# Super-Combat: A Graphical Card Game

Welcome to Super-Combat, an engaging graphical card game developed as part of the "Programming with C++" course at AUEB CS studies. This project leverages AUEB's <a href="https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg"> SGG library </a>.


## Project Overview:

Super-Combat is a result of dedicated effort and learning during the Programming with C++ course. The game brings together programming skills and creativity to deliver a modern gaming experience. 
Super-Combat plunges players into the epic world of superheroes and villains from popular comics. Each character possesses a unique set of abilities and effects, making the game dynamic and unpredictable. The key elements of the game include:

Random Card Mechanism: Players draw cards that represent attacks, shields, and health regeneration. The randomness adds an element of strategy and surprise to each round.

Unique Character Abilities: Each superhero or villain brings distinct powers to the table. These abilities affect the game balance, introducing a strategic layer that requires players to adapt their tactics.

The game is played in rounds, with players striving to reduce their opponent's health points. The battle continues until one player loses all their health points.



## Getting Started:

To run the game from Visual Studio, follow these simple steps:

1. Move the contents of the 'visual studio sln' folder to the same directory as the 'bin', '3rdparty', and 'Super Combat' folders.
2. Find the compiled binaries for both debug and release modes in the 'bin' folder.
3. Run the executable binary file.


## Directory Structure:

'bin': Contains compiled binaries for both debug and release modes.
'3rdparty': Essential third-party libraries used in the project.
'Super Combat': The main folder for the Super-Combat game.
'visual studio sln': Files for Visual Studio solution.
